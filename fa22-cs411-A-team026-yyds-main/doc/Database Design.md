## Inserting at least 1000 Rows
![1000](img/insert1k.jpg)
## Advance Query
### Advance Query1
Which Major is the Richestï¼Ÿ
```sql
SELECT StudyField, AVG(MarketPrice)
FROM `User` NATURAL JOIN Own NATURAL JOIN Skin
GROUP BY StudyField
```

![adq1](img/query1.jpg)
### Advance Query2
Which Major Makes English Speaking Pro Team Plays Better?
```sql
SELECT StudyField, AVG(Highest_Rank)
FROM `User` NATURAL JOIN
(SELECT TeamId, Highest_Rank
FROM Teams
WHERE `Language` = 'English' AND Lowest_Rank > 10) as engproteams
GROUP BY StudyField
```
![adq2](img/query2jpg.jpg)





## Indexing 

#### For query 1

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT StudyField, AVG(MarketPrice) as avg_price
FROM `User` NATURAL JOIN Own NATURAL JOIN Skin
GROUP BY StudyField
ORDER BY avg_price;
	
```



1. The 1st query without index is shown below.
![q1.0](img/q1.0.jpg)

2. Added index on MarketPrice of Skin table, which might be able to reduce the join cost. But it just slightly decreases the time for first step.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_marketprice ON Skin (MarketPrice);
```

![q1.1](img/q1.1.jpg)

3. Added index on UserId of Own table, which might be able to reduce the join cost. But it slightly decreases the time for first step and the aggregation.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_nt ON Own (UserId);
```
![q1.2](img/q1.2.jpg)

4. Added index on StudyField of User table, which still just slightly decreases the time for first step and the aggregation. We think the process of inner join could not be eliminated by an index.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_StudyField ON `User` (StudyField);
```
![q1.3](img/q1.3.jpg)
------

#### For query 2
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT StudyField, AVG(Highest_Rank)
FROM `User` NATURAL JOIN
(SELECT TeamId, Highest_Rank
FROM Teams
WHERE `Language` = 'English' AND Lowest_Rank > 10) as engproteams
GROUP BY StudyField
```
1. The 1st query without index is shown below.
![q2.0](img/q2.0.jpg)

2. Added index on StudyField of User table, which might be able to reduce the join cost. But it has no thing to do with final cost.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_StudyField ON `User` (StudyField);
```

![q2.1](img/q2.1.jpg)

3. Added index on Highest_Rank, which slightly decreases the time for first step while has no thing to do with cost.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_Highest_Rank ON Teams (Highest_Rank);
```
![q2.2](img/q2.2.jpg)

4. Added index on Language, which still slightly decreases the time for first step. Costs a lot for last step.
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_l ON Teams (Language);
```
![q2.3](img/q2.3.jpg)
------

#### Conclusion

We think it always cost more on the join step and add a key with that affects join and aggregation would help a lot.
